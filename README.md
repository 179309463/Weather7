# Weather7

Weather7 is the simple weather webapp that demonstrates how easy to create fully functioning iOS app with Framework7. With PhoneGap you can easily convert it to native iOS app.

### Weather7 Features

* Local Storage. All your personal weather data is stored in Local Storage, so you don't need to add weather locations each time you launch app.
* Manifest Cache. Due to Manifest Cache you can still access app without internet connection. You need internet connection only when you need to update weather data.
* YQL - fast and easy way to get the required data. Here we use YQL to search locations and get weather data for selected ones.
* Full Screen. Weather7 is a full screen app (on iOS). Just add it to your home screen to make sure. And the fun part is that with Framework7 you can easily control background color of status bar - click on "+" icon to open search popup and look at status bar.

Weather7 is a real fully functional iOS app
